To win this battle you must control a majority of the hosts for as long as possible. 

To take control of a host, write any value to its #CTRL register. Reading from a #CTRL register will tell if you (1) or your opponent (-1) controls the host.

     Gain one point every cycle you control more hosts than your opponent.

     Lose one point every time one of your EXAs executes a KILL instruction.

For more information see "Hacker Battle Domination" in the second issue of the zine.
