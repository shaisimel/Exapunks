To win this battle you must make your movies play for longer than your opponent's. A movie will play when that movie's file is the only movie file sitting in a *channel* host.

     Gain one point every cycle for each of your movies that is playing (files 210 and 211).

     Lose one point every cycle that a movie file that isn't yours (files 230, 231, and 265) is held by an EXA you control or is sitting in your host.

     Lose one point every time one of your EXAs executes a KILL instruction.

Note that you may only battle your Steam friends after beating the NPC opponent. To view the list of possible opponents, click the "SELECT OPPONENT" button above.

For more information see "Hacker Battle Domination" in the second issue of the zine.
