The Phage has begun to spread through your central nervous system. Hack it to ensure your heart can continue to beat.

"Read a value from the nerve connected to your central nervous system (CNS) and make your heart beat by writing a sequence of value to your sinoatrial (SA-N) and atrioventricular (AV-N) nodes as indicated in the HDI-10 I/O log when holding the SHOW GOAL button. The length of each sequence of values should be equal to the value from the CNS divided by -10. Repeat ad infinitum. It is not necessary to leave no trace."
