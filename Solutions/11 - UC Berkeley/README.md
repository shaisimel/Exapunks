Ember-2 needs a previously wiped file retrieved from the backup store at UC Berkeley.

"Locate the specified host (either tape-1, tape-2, or tape-3) and then locate the specified entry in the tape backup file in that host (file 200). Create a file in your host containing the entry's data. The names of the target host and entry are available in file 200."

Note that the hosts are arranged in a ring with LINK 800 taking you around the ring. You can only traverse the ring in one direction.
