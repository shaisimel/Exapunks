Move EMBER-2's new account (file 300) into *checking*. Then iterate over the checking accounts listed in the directory (file 199) and, in that order, transfer $1.00 from each target account to EMBER-2's account. Finally, add the file ID of EMBER-2's account file to the end of the directory.

The keywords ‗CREDIT‗ and ‗DEBIT‗ are available in file 301.
