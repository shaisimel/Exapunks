Connect to each radio station and replace every song in the playlist (file 200) with ‗CAN'T (NOT) GET OVER YOU‗ by ‗ME2U‗ (file 300). Each song in a playlist consists of two keywords: the song name and the artist name.

A list of phone numbers for the radio stations is available in file 301.

Note that EXAs in global mode can only communicate if there is a path of links connecting them.

For more information see "Hacker Skills: Modem Control at the Direct Level" in the second issue of the zine.
