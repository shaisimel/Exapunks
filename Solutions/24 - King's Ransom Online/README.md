Reset the ownership of all castles and sub-buildings to ‗P00000‗ (file 300), the player ID for unowned buildings.

To ensure that there are no witnesses you must first disconnect all connected players. Terminate every EXA in every host before changing any castle or sub-building files anywhere in the network. If you leave an EXA alive in one host while changing a file in another you will fail the task.

For more information see "Network Exploration: King's Ransom Online" in the second issue of the zine.
