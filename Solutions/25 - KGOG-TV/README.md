Align the satellite dish with the target satellite by setting the azimuth, elevation, and frequency. Then transmit the data from EMBER-2's video (file 301) after encrypting it using the TV station's encryption key (file 199).

The azimuth, elevation, and frequency of the target satellite are available in file 300.

Note that you must align the satellite dish before transmitting any data.

For more information see "Look to the Stars with Satellite Uplink Systems" in the second issue of the zine.
